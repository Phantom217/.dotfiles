## Introduction

This repository contains my personal configuration files (also known as
*dotfiles*). The package lists can be found in `~/.pkglist/`. To install all
official packages, you can use `cat .pkglist/pacman | pacman -S -`.

In the following sections I'll explain how this dotfiles repository was set up,
how to use it and how to restore them, for example, on a new device.

**Note**: This dotfiles repository is heavily influenced by the [.dotfiles
repository](https://github.com/alfunx/.dotfiles) by Alfunx. Most of the
configurations found here were modified from his configurations.
